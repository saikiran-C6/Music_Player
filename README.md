# Music_Player
This is a simple Music Player web application built using HTML and CSS.
Initially Homepage is created to view all the playlists, Song albums, Individual singers profiles to access to their music themes.
Later while playing the song the homepage is navigated to the single playlist screen which you will find in the output of the project.
For more information go through the code and view the output.
Thank you and Happy Coding!!!!
